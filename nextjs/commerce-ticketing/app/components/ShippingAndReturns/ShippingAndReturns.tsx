        <p>
          I am a Shipping Policy section. I am a great place to update your
          customers about your shipping methods, packaging and costs. Use plain,
          straightforward language to build trust and make sure that your
          customers stay loyal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am the second paragraph in your Shipping Policy section. Add your
          own text and edit me to get the words just how you like. Include
          details about your policy and be sure to mention any of the important
          details. I am a great place for you to add more information.

        <h2 className="text-3xl py-5 mt-10">RETURN & EXCHANGE POLICY</h2>
        <p>
          I am a return policy section. I am a great place to let your customers
          know what to do in case they’ve changed their mind about their
          purchase, or if they’re dissatisfied with a product. Having a
          straightforward refund or exchange policy is a great way to build
          trust and reassure your customers that they can buy with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am the second paragraph in your Return & Exchange policy. Add
          details about your policy and include anything you think is useful.
          Try to make the text easy to read. Let your customers know more, so
          they are well informed about their purchase and what happens if they
          need to return or exchange any items.
